# React Todo List

## Installation

To run this app on your own, all you need to do is clone/download the master branch and then follow these steps.

1. Install project dependencies using `npm install`
2. Run `npm run start` to start the React application
3. If it doesn't automatically, navigate to `localhost:3000` in your web browser.

> If you'd like to fully build the app, run `npm run build`. This will take longer but it will be more optimized and stable.
